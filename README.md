This is a bookdown version of the [Designing and Online Survey using Limesurvey](http://jon-may.github.io/limesurvey/docs/index.html). 

To revise, open the Rproj file in RStudio, then edit the relevant Chapter file (.Rmd)
Once editing is complete use the Build tab to build the book.

Copy the changed .Rmd files to these pages, and the .html pages to /docs, and any new iamges to /media and /docs/media.

Doing this requires you to have installed and loaded the bookdown package.
