# Data handling and security


## Confidentiality

An advantage of using our own Limesurvey implementation is that the data
is saved within the University computing environment, so there are no
third party data protection concerns.

Nevertheless, you must be very careful to avoid collecting personal data
within the survey that could identify the respondent, unless you
absolutely have to.

You must **never** ask for details such as names, initials, place of
birth, mother’s maiden name, student ID or email address.

If you are using SONA then you can identify your participant using the
unique Participant identifier that SONA can send to the survey (see
previous section). You can look up your participants in the Download
Participant List option in SONA to pair up the SONA id with an
individual. For this reason, your Limesurvey data is classed as ‘linked
anonymous’.

If you have a list of email addresses to send the survey invitation to,
then you can link that to a code number and include the code number in
the survey.

**Remember: Never ask anyone to enter their email address in the main
survey.**


## Chaining to another survey

If your survey is open to all anonymously, and you want to be able to
invite people to a follow-up survey, then you should forward them to a
second survey that does nothing other than record their email address,
so that it is not associated with their answers.

Make a new survey that has one question asking for an email address  
Validate the response to check that it is an email address

Make the practice survey link to this new survey when it is completed

You can use the End URL to send the participant’s random id code from
the first survey to another, standalone survey, where you can create a
separate survey that uses a **Short Free Text** question to record email
addresses. The second survey will also have to be set up to receive the
id, just as the first one was, using Panel Integration.


## Deleting Data from the platform

If you have pilot or testing data that you do not want to keep in the
datafile, then you can selectively delete the whole attempt before
opening the survey. Alternatively you can keep the test data and filter
it out during analysis (safer, in my view).

To remove individual responses from the data, click
**Responses** to see the data collected so far.
Check the box next to the row you want to delete, and then from the
Selected response(s)… menu at the bottom of the window, select
**Delete.** You will then need to click a scary red
box.

Arguably, once a survey is finished, and you have downloaded the data,
responses should be deleted from the survey platform.

To delete ALL of the data, for example at the end of the study once you
have downloaded the data, select all of the rows at once by checking the
box at the top of the column.


## Archiving and deleting old surveys

When you have completed a survey, downloaded the data, and are sure you
will not run it again, then you should download it for safe keeping. You
can then delete it from psysurvey to keep the list of your surveys
manageable, and to avoid the server filling up.

To download an archive for safekeeping, click the Export button at the
top of the screen :

Alternatively, you can export surveys from the Survey list page by
checking the box next to the survey and clicking Edit selected surveys.

If your study is still active, then you can download a limesurvey
archive (.lsa) that includes the data you have collected. If it is not
active, you can just download a limesurvey structure file (.lss) that
only contains the survey. The latter version is fine, as you will
already have downloaded your data separately.

Once you have exported it, you can delete it from the Survey list page
by selecting Delete from this page..

If you ever want to run the survey again, or make a modified version of
it, then you would use the purple Create Survey button and import an
.lsa or .lss file from your computer:
