# About this booklet {-}
This booklet accompanies a workshop, but can be used independently to
find out how to create an online survey using Limesurvey. This is
special purpose survey platform with better functionality than the forms
that are available in Google or Office.

The School of Psychology maintains its own Limesurvey server called [Psysurvey](https://psysurvey.plymouth.ac.uk)
